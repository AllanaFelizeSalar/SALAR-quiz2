        <p class="aboutp1"> 
            Time flies by so quickly. Thinking back, my elementary journey was like a movie, with a lot of things happening. 
            Elementary is six years of growing up and is presumably a period of your life where you explore and make a lot of peers.

    <h3 class="abouth32"> Highschool Journey </h3>

        <p class="aboutp2">
            Everything begins in highschool; your transfomation from a socially disorganized kid to a self - assured teen 
            throughout this phase of your education is brimming with exhilarating opportunities. High school is typically where 
            lifetime reputations and images are formed.

    <h3 class="abouth33"> Senior Highschool Journey </h3>

        <p class="aboutp3"> 
            Being a senior high school student implies having the ability to deal with and overcome the quintessential difficulties 
            and barriers that a typical student would experience.
            Senior high taught me a lot of lessons. These lessons helped me shape the person I am today.
